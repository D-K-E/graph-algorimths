**Proposition 1.2.1.** The number of vertices of odd degree in a graph is
always even.

**Proof**

:math:`|E| = {\frac{1}{2}} {\times} {\sum_{v \in V} d(v)}`

The formula reads as follows:

The number of edges E, of a graph G is equal to the half of the sum of all
the vertex degrees of G.
Since the sum is divisible to 2, the sum of all the vertex degrees of G should be even.
